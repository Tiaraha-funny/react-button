# Button component

### **Link:** https://competent-jackson-9e3ee8.netlify.app/

## Structure

- I import the react method by installing it first. 

- I created class with react component

- I set all the Button components that should shown on the state.

- I created a Button file to handle the function of the button contents.

- I got many conditions to style the classNames from the button component

## Difficulties

I hardly undersatnd the exercise ( lack of English skill). 

I didn't know what the prop.children work for. I strugled on how to set the defferents classes on the component.

## Improvement

I need improve the use of class name with the component instead of using objects.
